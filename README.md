### Description

Updated! Now this one you can change the game speed in the Options menu AND all options and New Game settings are saved in the Registry.

.

. I converted the QBasic GORILLAS game to VB 6.0 for my nephew. It's not a very difficult game to play (actually the challenge was in rewriting it :-) The code is only about 64.8% commented and there are routines that could have been written differently but this was not going to be a full blown project. Any way, take look at it if you will and let me know what ya think....... Have Fun...... P.S. It uses 1024x768
